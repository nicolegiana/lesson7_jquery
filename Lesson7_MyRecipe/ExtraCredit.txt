I added the animation of fadeTo and incorporated the DOM traversal of next. 
Next changed the selection to the sibling element following h3.
fadeTo adjusted the opacity of the sibling elements and I set it to do so with the duration of 600 milliseconds by choosing slow.
The CSS change I performed was changing the background color of the h3 elements when the mouse went over it.
